Now let’s take a look at the screen. On the left side, we find our column names (as well as some extra fields in italics, which for the purposes of this tutorial we can ignore) organized into two different categories: Dimensions and Measures. Put simply, a dimension is a field that identifies a piece of data, whereas a measure is a field that tells us, quantitatively, something about that data. So, ‘Region Name’ identifies a row of data as referring to a given region (such as Alabama), whereas ‘Utility Patent Count’ gives us a quantitative value for that row of data. Tableau will attempt to infer which fields are dimensions and which are measures, but sometimes it requires some adjusting. In this case, Tableau correctly identifies the ‘Region’, ‘Year’, ‘Class Code’ and ‘Class Name’ as dimensions, and ‘Utility Patent Count’ as our only measure. That is, ‘Region’, ‘Year’, ‘Class Code’ and ‘Class Name’ identify the scope of a particular row of data (or, in the case of Class Name, provide additional data on another dimension), and ‘Utility Patent Count’ represents a value for that scope.\n",

    "Looking great! There are some additional tweaks we could make, such as resizing the dashboard using the Dashboard section in the lower-left of the page, and either hiding or renaming the worksheet titles to something more meaningful than ‘treemap’ and ‘line,’ but making these changes is straightforward, . When you’re ready, select File -> Select to Tableau Public to start the publication process to the Tableau Public profile you created earlier. You’ll receive a log-in prompt for Tableau Public, then an opportunity to rename your workbook. Once saved, Tableau Public will open in your browser, and you’ll find the result of your hard work! Your visualization will be publicly available at this point. If you want to share your visualization with other people, either with a direct link or embedded into your own web page, check out the Share button on the bottom-right of the visualization.\n",
